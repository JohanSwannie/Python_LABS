# Python_LABS
#
# This project will showcase several examples pertaining to problem solving Python code
#
# Example 1 - "days_in_year_calculator"
# User input a given year, month and day of month - the program will then return the number of days for the year until the given date
#
# Example 2 - "strings_in_action"
# All actions described in the form of comments in the program
#
# Example 3 - "staircases_plus_christmastree"
# User enter input INT for each of the 3 cases and program print output of staircases for case 1 & 2 and a Christmas Tree for case 3
#
# Example 4 - "jumping_platforms"
# User enter amount of platforms + 0 for each safe platform and 1 for each unsafe platform - only one or 2 jumps allowed a at a time. The  # program will work out the total amount of safe jumps to the last platform, which is always a safe platform
#
# Example 5 - 'inheritance"
# User input student name, surname & ID on same line. The input the amount of scores - and then the actual scores.
# The program will work out the average score of the student and return the details of the student together with the symbol achieved 
#
# Example 7 - 'date_time_general'
# General Date Time functions to manipulate date and time
