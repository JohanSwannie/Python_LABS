# Python_LABS
#
# This project will showcase several examples pertaining to problem solving Python code
#
# Example 1 - "days_in_year_calculator"
# User input a given year, month and day of month - the program will then return the number of days for the year until the given date
#
# Example 2 - "strings_in_action"
# All actions described in the form of comments in the program
#
# Example 3 - "staircases_plus_christmastree"
# User enter input INT for each of the 3 cases and program print output of staircases for case 1 & 2 and a Christmas Tree for case 3
#
# Example 4 - "jumping_platforms"
# User enter amount of platforms + 0 for each safe platform and 1 for each unsafe platform - only one or 2 jumps allowed a at a time. The  # program will work out the total amount of safe jumps to the last platform, which is always a safe platform
#
# Example 5 - 'inheritance"
# User input student name, surname & ID on same line. The input the amount of scores - and then the actual scores.
# The program will work out the average score of the student and return the details of the student together with the symbol achieved 
#
# Example 6 - 'summing'
# USe the sum method in python to perform all kinds of summing
#
# Example 7 - 'date_time_general'
# General Date Time functions to manipulate date and time 
#
# Example 8 - 'human_readable_time'
# User input seconds within 1 days range and program return the human readable time in format HH:MM:SS (hours, minutes + seconds)
# 
# Example 9 - 'average_calculations'
# User input any amount of positive numbers, negative numbers and zeros - program will the return the average for each case of the overall # amount of numbers entered
#
# Example 10 - 'useful_methods_functions'
# Some useful methods in Python - 1) Filtering 2) Zipping 3) Ordinal Numbers 4) Mapping 5) Lambda expressions 6) Reduce Function
#
# Example 11 - 'more_useful_functions'
# More useful functions in Python - 1) Sorted 2) Enumerate 3) Reversed 4) Range 5) Min & Max 6) Chr 7) Any & All
#
# Example 12 - 'list_methods'
# Examples of all methods in lists as well as a touch on list comprehensions
#
# Example 13 - 'tuples_plus_sets_methods'
# Examples of methods in tuples & sets
# 
# Example 14 - 'random'
# A few examples to show how the random module can be used to perform functions etc etc...
#
# Example 15 - 'lambda_functions_calculator'
# Example of how lambda functions can be used to perform all sorts of calculation operations
#
# Example 16 - 'binaries'
# Examples of how to convert binary to character decimals, integer decimals & vice versa + reading Binary files
#
# Example 17 - 'all_sorts'
# Example of several methods, functions etc in Python
#
# Example 18
# Examples of general exercises in Python 
#
# Example 19
# Examples of Iterators and Generators
